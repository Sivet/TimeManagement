# TimeManagement
Simple time management for keeping track of hours spent.

Normal use is to set the startup part to be run on either boot or login, and the shutdown part to be run on either shutdown or logoff.
The Break script is meant to be used manually by running it when starting a break.

Build the startup and shutdown separately with pyinstaller, if needed as exe files.
